Columnstore indexes are able to store data in a compressed form. This means that they read compressed data from the disk and fewer bytes of data need to be read into memory and this reduces the IO needed to execute queries. Storing data by compressing columns mean that less space is taken up on disk. This is because data compression techniques achieve higher compression rates when values are similar. Values in a column are ususally similar. They can also skip reading in data from columns which do not match the requirements for a query. This is done by organising and compressing the data column by column so that entire rows do not need to be read to obtain the relevant information. Extra data is not read into memory.
Before creating the columnstore index, the data was not compressed and IO was not reduced. There was no column elimination so the query processor had to read in every row to decide whether the conditions of the query were met.
